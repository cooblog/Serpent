/**
 * Renderer-side coordinator for the background-task status fallback queries
 * (`media.list-jobs`, `ai.status`, `plugin.jobs.list`).
 *
 * Before this module the renderer polled all three once per second for every
 * open library, unconditionally, and started a second identical stream while
 * the Background Tasks panel was open. Nothing coalesced them, so a Worker that
 * was blocked for 30 seconds accumulated 30 overlapping requests per kind on
 * top of an already deep queue (Serpent-e97c00 / Serpent-52eed4).
 *
 * Invariants this class is responsible for:
 *  - at most one in-flight request per kind, per library generation;
 *  - any number of requests that arrive while a kind is in flight collapse into
 *    exactly one follow-up, so pending stays O(1) no matter how long the owner
 *    is blocked;
 *  - results that arrive after the library changed (or after stop) are dropped
 *    instead of overwriting fresher state;
 *  - polling backs off when nothing is active, the panel is closed, and no job
 *    event has arrived recently; a job event immediately refreshes and returns
 *    to the fast cadence;
 *  - a hidden window stops polling entirely and does one coalesced refresh when
 *    it becomes visible again.
 *
 * Worker events stay the primary source of truth for whether work is active;
 * this coordinator is the bounded fallback. Media counts now come from
 * `media.job-summary` (O(1)); `media.list-jobs` is only for the open panel's
 * cursor pages.
