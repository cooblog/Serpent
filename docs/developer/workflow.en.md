# Branching and Development Workflow

This document is for contributors and maintainers participating in Serpent development. It explains the repository's long-lived branching architecture, external contribution workflow, and internal maintainer practices.

## 1. Branch Roles: `main` and `dev`

| Branch | Purpose | What belongs there | Access and releases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `main` | **Release baseline and public branch** | Stable code, automated tests, runtime resources, public documentation (including `docs/developer/`), and build configuration | Default public branch, release packaging baseline |
| `dev` | **Daily development integration branch** | Everything in `main`, plus internal tickets (`.beads/`), development logs, and slice designs (`docs/internal/`) | Target branch for feature development and PR integration |

- `main` is designed to be "ready to release, stable, and transparently public", delivered to users and the open-source community with releases;
- `dev` supports active development and historical development evidence;
- **All external Pull Requests must target `dev`**.

## 2. External Contributor Workflow (GitHub Collaboration)

The recommended workflow for external developers participating in Serpent:

### 2.1 Preparation

1. Fork the [dolag233/Serpent](https://github.com/dolag233/Serpent) repository on GitHub;
2. Clone your forked repository to your local development environment (do not place it on SMB/NAS network shares):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Serpent.git
   cd Serpent
   ```
3. Follow the [Setup Guide](setup.en.md) to configure Node.js 24 and dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm ci --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org
   npm run rebuild:native
   ```
4. Check out the latest `dev` branch and create your feature or bugfix branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature-name
   ```

### 2.2 Development and Quality Gates

When making changes, adhere to these engineering principles:

1. **Type safety and code style**: Pass static TypeScript type checking and ESLint before committing:
   ```bash
   npm run typecheck
   npm run lint
   ```
2. **Test coverage**:
   - Add unit tests for pure logic to `tests/unit/`;
   - Add tests for Worker or SQLite operations to `tests/worker/`;
   - Run targeted tests to verify your changes:
     ```bash
     npm run test:unit -- tests/unit/<your-test-file>.test.ts
     ```
   - If changes touch library opening, database migrations, or underlying filesystem operations, pass the library availability suite:
     ```bash
     npm run test:library-availability
     ```
3. **Workspace cleanliness and privacy sanitization**:
   - Committed files **must never contain local absolute paths, personal usernames, drive letters, private credentials, or temporary test media**;
   - Test artifacts must be created in temporary directories and cleaned up when tests complete.

### 2.3 Commit Message Conventions (Conventional Commits)

Commit messages should clearly state the intent and scope of the change using standard conventions:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <short description>
```

- **`type`** common categories:
  - `feat`: New user-facing feature or interaction;
  - `fix`: Bug fix;
  - `docs`: Documentation only;
  - `test`: Adding or fixing tests;
  - `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature;
  - `chore`: Tooling, build pipeline, or dependency updates.
- **`scope`** optional modules: `canvas`, `viewer`, `library`, `worker`, `mcp`, `plugin`, `shell`, etc.

Examples:
```bash
git commit -m "fix(viewer): autoplay video smoothly after navigation"
git commit -m "feat(canvas): add hover scrub position preview"
```

### 2.4 Pull Requests and Code Review

For detailed step-by-step instructions, quality gate requirements, and environment setup, see the [Contributing Guide](contributing.en.md).

1. Push your local branch to your fork on GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-feature-name
   ```
2. Open a Pull Request on GitHub, **ensuring the Base branch is `dev`**;
3. Clearly state the purpose of the change, affected scope, and local test evidence in the PR description;
4. Maintainers will review the PR, request any necessary adjustments, and merge it into `dev`;
5. Merged contributions will be acknowledged in [`CONTRIBUTORS.md`](../../CONTRIBUTORS.md) in the root directory.

## 3. Core Maintainer Workflow (Internal Engineering & Release Discipline)

This section applies to core maintainers and contributors with repository write permissions, outlining ticket tracking and release merging disciplines.

### 3.1 Internal Ticket Tracking (`.beads/`)

The core team tracks daily tasks on the `dev` branch using lightweight plain-text tickets:

```bash
# View ready tasks
node scripts/ticket.mjs ready --json
# Claim a ticket
node scripts/ticket.mjs claim <issue-id>
# Close a completed ticket
node scripts/ticket.mjs status <issue-id> closed --reason "Resolution description, with commit hash"
```

*Note: Ticket data is stored in `.beads/issues.jsonl` and versioned directly with Git.*

### 3.2 Internal Slices and Design Docs (`docs/internal/`)

Major vertical slice developments maintain technical specifications, development logs, and code review records in `docs/internal/`. These process artifacts remain on the `dev` branch to trace architectural evolution.

### 3.3 Release Merging and Public Branch Stripping

When features on `dev` reach the release milestone and need to be merged into `main`, the following rules apply:

1. **Single merge commit stripping internal files**:
   - Internal development files (including `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/internal/`, `.beads/`, `.github/`, etc.) belong only on `dev` and must never pollute the public `main` baseline;
   - `docs/developer/` is public developer and contributor documentation and **must remain on `main`**;
   - Merging is done in a single commit: stripping internal files while merging from `dev` to `main`, preventing "add-then-remove" commit churn on the public branch.
2. **Packaging and building must be performed on `dev`**:
   - The packaging pipeline enforces comprehensive verification gates; formal release artifacts are generated on `dev` via `npm run release:local`;
   - Run `npm run rebuild:native` after packaging to restore the native dev environment.
